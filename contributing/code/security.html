<p>This document explains how Symfony security issues are handled by the
Symfony core team (Symfony being the code hosted on the main <code translate="no" class="notranslate">symfony/symfony</code>

    Reporting a Security Issue
    <a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-a-security-issue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If you think that you have found a security issue in Symfony, don't use the
bug tracker and don't publish it publicly. Instead, all security issues must
be sent to <strong>security [at] symfony.com</strong>. Emails sent to this address are
forwarded to the Symfony core team private mailing-list.</p>
<p>The following issues are not considered security issues and should be handled
as regular bug fixes (if you have any doubts, don't hesitate to send us an
email for confirmation):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any security issues found in debug tools that must never be enabled in
production (including the web profiler or anything enabled when <code translate="no" class="notranslate">APP_DEBUG</code>
is set to <code translate="no" class="notranslate">true</code> or <code translate="no" class="notranslate">APP_ENV</code> set to anything but <code translate="no" class="notranslate">prod</code>);</li>
<li>Any fix that can be classified as <strong>security hardening</strong> like route
enumeration, login throttling bypasses, denial of service attacks, timing
attacks, or lack of <code translate="no" class="notranslate">SensitiveParameter</code> attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the core team has the final decision on which issues are
considered security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Symfony is an Open-Source project where most of the work is done by volunteers.
We appreciate that developers are trying to find security issues in Symfony and
report them responsibly, but we are currently unable to pay bug bounties.</p>

<p>For each report, we first try to confirm the vulnerability. When it is
confirmed, the core team works on a solution following these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
    <li>Send an acknowledgment to the reporter;</li>
<li>Work on a patch;</li>
<li>Get a CVE identifier from <a href="https://cveform.mitre.org/" class="reference external" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mitre.org</a>;</li>
<li><p>Write a security announcement for the official Symfony <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/" class="reference external">blog</a> about the
vulnerability. This post should contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a title that always include the &quot;Security release&quot; string;</li>
<li>a description of the vulnerability;</li>
<li>the affected versions;</li>
<li>the possible exploits;</li>
<li>how to patch/upgrade/workaround affected applications;</li>
<li>the CVE identifier;</li>
<li>credits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Send the patch and the announcement to the reporter for review;</li>
<li>Apply the patch to all maintained versions of Symfony;</li>
<li>Package new versions for all affected versions;</li>
<li>Publish the post on the official Symfony <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/" class="reference external">blog</a> (it must also be added to
the &quot;`Security Advisories`_&quot; category);</li>
<li>Update the public <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" class="reference external" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">security advisories database</a> maintained by the
FriendsOfPHP organization and which is used by
<a href="../../setup.html#security-checker" class="reference internal">the check:security command</a>.</li>

    Collaborating with Downstream Open-Source Projects
    <a class="headerlink" href="#collaborating-with-downstream-open-source-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>As Symfony is used by many large Open-Source projects, we standardized the way
the Symfony security team collaborates on security issues with downstream
projects. The process works as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
    <li>After the Symfony security team has acknowledged a security issue, it
immediately sends an email to the downstream project security teams to
inform them of the issue;</li>
<li>The Symfony security team creates a private Git repository to ease the
collaboration on the issue and access to this repository is given to the
Symfony security team, to the Symfony contributors that are impacted by
the issue, and to one representative of each downstream projects;</li>
<li>All people with access to the private repository work on a solution to
solve the issue via pull requests, code reviews, and comments;</li>
<li>Once the fix is found, all involved projects collaborate to find the best
date for a joint release (there is no guarantee that all releases will
be at the same time but we will try hard to make them at about the same
time). When the issue is not known to be exploited in the wild, a period
of two weeks is considered a reasonable amount of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The list of downstream projects participating in this process is kept as small
as possible in order to better manage the flow of confidential information
prior to disclosure. As such, projects are included at the sole discretion of
the Symfony security team.</p>
<p>As of today, the following projects have validated this process and are part
of the downstream projects included in this process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drupal (releases typically happen on Wednesdays)</li>
<li>eZPublish</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to determine the severity of a security issue we take into account
the complexity of any potential attack, the impact of the vulnerability and
also how many projects it is likely to affect. This score out of 15 is then
converted into a level of: Low, Medium, High, Critical, or Exceptional.</p>

<li>2 - 3 Complex: attacker must follow non-intuitive steps with a high level
of dependencies</li>
<li>1 - 2 High: A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's
control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but
requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in
preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful
attack can be expected.</li>

If so, does the attacker have control over the data disclosed? (0-4)</li>

system) to be compromised? If so, does the attacker have control over
modification? (0-4)</li>
<li>Code Execution: Does the vulnerability allow arbitrary code to be executed
on an end-users system, or the server that it runs on? (0-4)</li>
<li>Availability: Is the availability of a service or application affected? Is
it reduced availability or total loss of availability of a service /
